11eyes CrossOver localization patch releases

[How to use](https://github.com/ThePlayer14/eleveneyes-xbox360-patch-releases/blob/main/USAGE.md)
# What's supported by this patch?
* The `.scr` scripts that can be extracted by [MagesTools](https://github.com/ThePlayer14/MagesTools_en) or [sc3tools_mod](https://github.com/ThePlayer14/sc3tools_mod) .

# Limitations of the patch
* The UI for the game cannot be localized. All UI interface BMP files, including the character atlas (`011.bmp`) are stored within the `system.dat` file, which is an LNK4 archive.
Only an unpacker named [exlnk4](https://github.com/hiroshil/asmodean-tools/tree/main/exlnk4) is known to exist, but not a packer for this format.
